"""Human handoff actions for ``computer_use`` on a Bot Desktop: ``request_handoff`` asks the person to
take over the screen (login, 2FA, CAPTCHA, payment) and ``wait_for_human`` blocks until control is
back. Both are answered without touching cua-driver, so a human typing a credential is never
captured.

The Desktop pane shows the request (the gateway broadcasts the lease change). Reaching the person
anywhere else is the model's job: it relays the ask in its reply, which is what lands in the chat
surface the user is actually on. This module only records intent on the lease and waits.
